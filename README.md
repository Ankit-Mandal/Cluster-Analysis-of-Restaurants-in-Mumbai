Then we utilize Foursquare and Zomato APIs to explore various restaurant venues within the city. 

1. Black Mrakers - Rating within (4,5)
2. Red Markers - Rating within (3,4)
3. Orange Markers - Rating within (2,3)

Lastly, we use Clustering technique to group the restaurants obtained into 3 clusters.

1. Blue Cluster - Medium Price Range, Very Good rating
2. Red Cluster - High Price Range, Very Good rating
3. Yellow Cluster - Low Price Range, Good rating
